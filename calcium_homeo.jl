# Calcium homeostasis in a STG neuron 

### Introduction
- Intracellular calcium concentration is an important signal to monitor in any neuron because it is involved in various metabolic and neuromodulatory processes. 

- For example, calcium acts as a second-messenger signalling through regulatory pathways for growth, energy efficiency, and genetic expression.

- This means that keeping calcium concentration within a tight range is essential to achieve proper function. We'll refer to this as calcium homeostasis. 


- But changes in the electrical activity imply changes in calcium concentration. Why? 

- Calcium closely correlates with a neuron's electrical activity due to voltage dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channels and buffering mechanisms that average out fluctuations in time and space. 

We'll breifly explain how the homeostatic constraints interact with naturally ocurring and ongoing electrical variations.

#### Homeostatic control of conductances

- Calcium is known to regulate the genetic expression of the proteins that conform ion channels through calcium-dependent promotion or repression of transcription factors. 

- The ion channel densities (or maximal conductances, $g$) determine the electrical activity of the neuron, which, in turn, determines the influx of calcium to the cell.

The feedback loop involving intracellular calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]$, can be schematized as follows:

So intracellular calcium concentration 
- acts as a sensor, monitoring average activity over time, and 
- adjusts membrane conductances to achieve some kind of target calcium concentration or _homeostatic set-point_.

## What is done in this notebook

In this notebook we'll explore which sets of neuronal parameters (conductances) are compatible with the _homeostatic set-point_ by evolving curves where the change in average calcium is minimally disruptive. While we won't model the homeostatic controller, the minimally disruptive curves **for an appropriate cost function** can adjust the parameters to prevent deviation from calcium target.

### 6. Scientific analysis

We analyse the first curve. Its initial direction involves only T-type and slow calcium conductances. 

- Slow calcium and T-type calcium, as well as calcium-activated potassium channels, are a source of ultraslow negative feedback to the membrane potential and therefore crucial for bursting. 

- They mostly cooperate in shaping adaptation properties of the neuron.

- However, CaS and CaT tune different properties: 

	- Slow calcium channel density modulates intra-burst frequency

	- T-type calcium channels also play a role in fast excitability properties : they can generate spike upstroke (in the absence of sodium this is interesting!)

#### Static curve and cost

Around the starting point of the curve, see the interval (-0.3, 0.5), only CaS and CaT change. 

- They change **linearly**, indicating that correlations between the expression of ion channels are behind the observed degeneracy. In other words, it's not the absolute values of conductances that determine a cell's activity but the relative ratios of the conductances that it expresses.

- This agrees with many experimental and computational results ([Schulz et al., 2007](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0705827104); [Zhao and Golowasch, 2012](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/39/13380); [O’Leary et al., 2013](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1309966110); [O’Leary et al., 2014](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(14)00292-X.pdf))


- They change in **opposite directions** because they both control burstiness. Increasing them together would result in higher burstiness. 
- In particular, increasing CaT would lead to a depolarization block. (The effect of increasing both calcium densities is predicted analytically [here](https://www.eneuro.org/content/2/1/ENEURO.0031-14.2015)).
- But then voltage-gated calcium channels which open upon depolarizarion would allow more calcium to flow inside the cell.

md"""
When the initial direction is no longer a good one, more conductances start to move. 

- See the interval (0.5, 1.5) As T-type calcium and sodium increase, all potassium conductances decrease. This balances the excitability levels of the neuron


- In the last portion of this curve, changes in conductances roughly preserve behavior and therefore average calcium too.


- Note that the cost function stays well below 1 most of the time, wich means that the deviation from target calcium is << 10% (since $Ca_{tgt}$ is 10 $\mu M$).
